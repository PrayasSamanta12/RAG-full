Vector databases have emerged as critical infrastructure for AI-driven applications by enabling the fast, approximate search of high-dimensional embeddings. Unlike traditional relational stores, vector DBs represent data points as mathematical vectors, supporting similarity queries, KNN search, and clustering. This approach underpins semantic retrieval in RAG systems, recommendation engines, and fraud detection. Technologies such as Pinecone, Weaviate, and ChromaDB offer APIs to store, update, and query embeddings generated by models like BERT or CLIP. They optimize for speed and scalability with techniques including approximate neighbors, distributed indexing, and GPU acceleration. Advanced filtering and metadata support enable hybrid retrieval for context-aware generative AI solutions.
