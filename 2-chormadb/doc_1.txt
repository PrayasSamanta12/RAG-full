Docker containers have revolutionized application deployment by encapsulating all dependencies within lightweight, portable units. The container lifecycle runs through image creation, build, run, and destruction, allowing consistency across environments from a developer’s laptop to cloud production servers. Networking and persistent storage are handled through Docker’s bridge networks and mounted volumes, often configured in a YAML file for orchestration. Security features, resource limits, and automated health checks help maintain uptime and isolation. Command-line tools and APIs provide granular control, while platforms like Kubernetes extend management to large-scale clusters. Docker’s architecture enables microservices, CI/CD pipelines, and efficient scaling for modern software infrastructure.
