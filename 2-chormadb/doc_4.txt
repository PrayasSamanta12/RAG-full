In Node.js, the event loop is a key mechanism that allows non-blocking I/O operations on a single thread. Each incoming request is delegated to the system kernel, freeing the JavaScript runtime to handle other events. Async callbacks are queued and executed when the kernel signals completion, drastically improving throughput. Promises and async/await syntax further simplify asynchronous code management, reducing callback hell and enhancing maintainability. Node.js excels in microservices, web servers, and real-time applications like chat or streaming services. Its event-driven model, combined with fast V8 execution, supports horizontal scaling and resource-efficient concurrency on modest hardware, making Node.js immensely popular for backend services.
