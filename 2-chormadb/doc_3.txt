SQL query optimization is crucial for scalable database operations. Indexing frequently searched columns is an essential strategy, but too many indexes can degrade write performance. Queries should avoid ‘SELECT *’, minimize joins to essential tables, and use WHERE clauses that leverage indexed columns. Tools like EXPLAIN PLAN visualize execution steps, guiding developers to restructure queries for efficiency. Partitioning large tables can improve access speed while reducing locking contention. Regularly updating table statistics ensures the optimizer selects the best execution path. Avoiding correlated subqueries and using batch processing techniques can reduce resource consumption. These approaches together lead to faster, more reliable database systems.
