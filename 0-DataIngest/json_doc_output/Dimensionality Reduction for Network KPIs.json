Introduction Management tasks in current mobile networks, such as network optimization or fault management, have become cumbersome and expensive, due to the high complexity of modern networks, thus increasing both the operational and the capital expenditure (OPEX and CAPEX, respectively). In order to overcome this, the automation of such management tasks has become an important challenge, which is even more relevant for 5G networks [1]. However, the huge amount of available data related to different services and network segments decreases the efficiency of the automation of such management functions due to the fact that storage and algorithms are not prepared to work with such big data.

To know the current network state (e.g., whether the network behavior is sub-optimal or degraded), these management functions rely on network performance indicators, which in the context of cellular networks are called key performance indicators (KPI). These indicators quantify the performance of network processes and functionalities and are monitored and stored by the Operations Support System (OSS) of the cellular network. As a result, and for network management tasks to be optimally performed, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and vendors have put a lot of effort into arranging a sufficiently detailed and varied amount of KPIs. However, many of these KPIs do not provide relevant information about the network state. The result is a large amount of data that has to be stored in network nodes, causing storage problems. Moreover, such amount of data may produce over-fitting of the algorithms used for the automation of the management tasks. To avoid these problems, an efficient selection of a set of KPIs should be carried out in order to optimize the network management tasks",

To cope with this issue, dimensionality reduction has become an essential preprocessing task. Regarding cellular network management, few works have been reported in this field. Some works have applied feature selection techniques with the aim of classifying traffic flows. For example, in [3], a supervised correlation-based technique for KPI selection is applied in a UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) network. In [4], however, authors applied dimensionality reduction to improve the classification of Internet traffic. In [5,6], supervised techniques for automatic feature selection are applied to determine the most useful KPIs to eventually identify the cause for a performance degradation in a cellular network. Specifically, in [5], a supervised technique based on a genetic algorithm is proposed. The authors of [6] also propose a supervised method, which relies on the statistical dissimilarity of KPIs when conditioned to different network states",

However, given their supervised nature, the works in [5,6] rely on the availability of a network status label attached to every network observation, which seldom is present. Actually, most of the performance management data stored in nowadays cellular networks are unlabeled, due to the high amount of time required for network experts to analyze and document every network fault, together with the pressing need for a fast response. In this case, an unsupervised selection method can be applied for dimensionality reduction which carries out a selection of a representative set of KPIs. Specifically, in [7], an unsupervised technique for KPI selection is proposed as a clustering module followed by a supervised feature selection technique. In addition to feature selection, dimensionality reduction encompasses a second family of Machine Learning techniques, which is feature extraction. Feature extraction techniques convert the original features into a new and lower-dimensional set of synthetic features. The application of feature extraction to cellular network management is presented in several works",

In [9], different techniques for dimensionality reduction are applied to time series prediction. Finally, Ref. [10] is focused on the combination of selection and extraction techniques as part of a fault management framework. A possible limitation of the application of dimensionality reduction methods to management tasks is a reduction in the accuracy of the results. Regarding this issue, a trade-off between accuracy and storage needs must be achieved. These types of decisions are common in autonomic management problems [11]. This paper presents a detailed comparison among different feature extraction techniques and their application to a fault diagnosis problem.

These new features contain the most important information from the original dataset regarding the scenario where this technique is being applied. Therefore, the considered problem for the application of feature extraction has an important impact on the final result. The objective of this work is to analyze the suitability of the mostly used families of techniques for feature extraction when they are applied to a fault diagnosis problem in a cellular network. The use of these techniques may not only reduce the dimensionality of the diagnosis problem, but also improve the fault diagnosis results.

Secondly, an overview of feature extraction techniques is described, focusing on two specific feature extraction families. Then, the performance analysis is shown. Details of the experiments carried out and obtained results are provided. Finally, some conclusions are drawn from the previous study and tests. 2. Problem Formulation In a cellular network, performance information is monitored and periodically stored in a centralized database: the OSS database (see dashed lines in Figure 1). This information usually takes the shape of service or network performance metrics (such as KPIs), as well as user call traces, and may be expressed as a set of N-dimensional samples, ̄x = {x1, x2, . . . , xN}, being N the number of the monitored metrics, that is, the number of features. A feature could be, for example, the number of user connection attempts registered by a base station in a given time period",

In the context of cellular networks, this means that a new set of synthetic KPIs are built upon the combination of the original ones retaining as much information as possible. Therefore, a feature extraction technique is a process that transforms an element ̄x ∈RN, defined by the features {x1, . . . , xN}, in an element ̃x ∈Rq, defined by the features { ̃x1, . . . , ̃xq}, where each new feature ̃xj comes from the combination of several features of ̄x.

The reason why feature extraction techniques get to retain a higher amount of useful information than feature selection techniques given the same number of resulting features is that not all the information retained in the selected (contrary to the extracted) KPIs is useful information. This fact is mainly due to the nature of the magnitude being quantified and its suitability to represent the performance of the underlying process. At this point, the utility of a feature, or KPI, can be quantified as its variance with respect to the variance of the whole dataset, considering all the KPIs. Often, the techniques for feature extraction have as the criterion that the per-feature variance is maximized, thus reducing the number of necessary features to retain the whole variance. This is the case for the techniques based on principal component analysis (PCA) [14]. This work is focused on the application of two of the most promising feature extraction families to cellular network performance analysis.

Performance Analysis In order to show the feasibility of feature extraction techniques for cellular network management, in this section, the presented methods have been assessed regarding their ability to reduce the number of features at the input of a method for fault diagnosis while preserving as much useful information as possible. 4.1. Experiment Setup A test has been carried out to evaluate the performance of the considered feature extraction techniques in the field of fault diagnosis. In the experiments, a dataset from a live LTE network with 359 samples has been used [20].

First, to set a baseline, all the KPIs are used, representing the situation when no selection is performed. Then, four techniques based on component analysis have been assessed: PCA, kPCA using a Gaussian kernel (named kPCA1 onwards), kPCA using a sigmoid kernel (named kPCA2 onwards) and ICA.

One approach to reduce this variance is the application of repetitions in the experiments. With the aim of obtaining more reliable results when the number of cases is scarce either in the testing or in the modeling set, a stratified Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) of 50 repetitions has been performed per each step of the modeling-to-testing ratio.

The reason for the good results of PCA comes from the nature of the KPIs being monitored and the relation they have among each other, being fundamentally linear. In turn, this linearity appears from the nature of the processes being quantified, this being a common issue in cellular networks. The process to obtain KPIs from a network consists of the application of different formulas for the combination of performance counters. These performance counters are metrics gathered by the different nodes of the network and are related to the different procedures that are taking place. Some examples of these counters are the number of connection attempts or the number of successful connections. Based on these metrics, KPIs such as the ratio of successful connections can be obtained. Thus, KPIs that are obtained based on similar performance counters can present a high linear relation. It is also possible to find KPIs that are not related to other KPIs",

For example, a KPI related to cell availability (meaning the time during an hour that the cell is available) is not related to any other KPI. However, most of the common KPIs are related to at least other KPI in a linear manner. To confirm this behavior, Pearson correlation coefficients have been obtained and represented by means of their cumulative density function, Figure 6. Specifically, the correlation for every pair of KPIs from the considered dataset has been obtained. It can be seen that more than 50% of the obtained coefficients are above 0.5, indicating a high level of linearity among KPIs.",

In the case of kPCA2, the normalization of the KPIs and the distribution of many of them around zero makes the sigmoid kernel approximate to a linear function, providing an optimum final DER, similar to the one provided by PCA. On the other hand, the resulting DERs of both kPCA1 and the techniques based on manifold learning provide poorer results, even worse than the baseline case for LLE. The reason is that these techniques assume a strong nonlinearity in the dataset, which is contrary to the linear character of the relations among the considered KPIs.

Based on this large amount of information, experts must analyze the performance of the network and not only detect if the network behavior is normal, but also identify the specific problem that is affecting a specific area of the network. Moreover, when the decision is based on real data, it is important to consider that part of this information may affect the accuracy of the classification negatively. This fact is shown in the baseline results, obtaining a worse DER when all the available information is used to make the fault classification. Based on these results, the application of feature extraction techniques to a mobile network management allows for reducing the storage needs up to 96% (using 10 KPIs instead of all 286 monitored KPIs) while improving the DER of a subsequent diagnosis stage more than 50%. The possible limitations of this approach are a possible reduction in the accuracy of the results, an increase in the complexity of the system and its adaptation to changes in the network. In relation to the former, it is important to take into account that an extremely high reduction may reduce the accuracy of the diagnosis result",

Regarding the adaptation of changes in the network, it represents the main limitation of this approach. When the feature extraction method is applied to a network, the main KPIs to perform the fault diagnosis are determined in order to compute the synthetic KPIs that will be used in the fault diagnosis stage. This selection is specific for the concrete faults that are being considered. If new faults appear in the network, it will be necessary to perform the training of the feature extraction method again in order to adapt the KPI selection including these new faults. One possible approach could be to perform this training periodically, so that the feature extraction method would be adapted to network changes. 5.

The benefits have been found to be specially relevant when linear techniques for feature extraction are used, given the mostly linear dependence of the most common KPIs.
