In recent years, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has seen significant advancements, particularly in machine learning and deep learning techniques. These technologies enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. AI applications span various industries, including healthcare, finance, and transportation, where they enhance capabilities such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. As AI continues to evolve, ethical considerations around bias, privacy, and transparency remain critical topics of discussion.
